# perceptron_comp337

This is the simply python code about the perceptron including binary classification and multi classification. The goal is to classificate the data set having 3 different class. 

The binary classification has only one output and the math rule is y=wx+b, and we can make b=w_bias*bias (bias=1); therefore, the final function is y=w'*x'.

The binary classification has two output. The fist one is marked as 01, second one to be 10 and the third one to be 11. Those labels are in binary, which means the every output can print only 0 and 1.

# Approach
The input of the data can only be read by reading the path.
